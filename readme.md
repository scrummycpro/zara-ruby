# Ruby Command Line Tool

## Overview

This Ruby script is a simple command line tool that allows users to select and execute various commands. It presents a menu of options for the user to choose from, such as listing files, opening Vim, or opening Visual Studio Code. The script is interactive, guiding the user through the selection process and executing the chosen command.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: The script displays a menu of options for the user to choose from.
- **Customizable Commands**: Users can easily customize the commands available in the menu.
- **Colorful Output**: The menu options and user prompts are displayed in various colors for enhanced readability.
- **Error Handling**: The script handles invalid user input gracefully and prompts the user to try again.
- **Python Script Integration**: The script executes a Python script named "test.py" before presenting the menu.

## Requirements

- Ruby: Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system to run the script.
- Python: The script executes a Python script named "test.py", so make sure Python is installed as well.
